### Getting started

Trufi Core is the base dependency used to create your public transport app. Have a look at the [example](example) implementation that contains further instructions.

#### Preparing environment

1. Copy the contents of the folder `example` into a new repository. See [trufi-app](https://github.com/trufi-association/trufi-app) for an example because we did it like what described below.

2. Modify `pubspec.yml`:
   Replace the content

   ```yaml
     trufi_core:
       path: ../
   ```

   with
   ```yaml
     trufi_core:
       git:
         url: https://github.com/trufi-association/trufi-core.git
         ref: main
   ```

   to be able to use this library - trufi-core
   
3. Prepare your development environment so you can compile it successfully

#### Making necessary modifications

1. Edit [main.dart](./example/lib/main.dart) and modify the necessary things
   1. Offline search POI functionality: remove `photonUrl` and generate your own version of the `assets/data/search.json` using [osm-search-data-export](https://github.com/trufi-association/osm-search-data-export).
   2. Online search POI functionality: remove `searchAssetPath`

2. Change [drawer-bg.jpg](./example/assets/images/drawer-bg.jpg)

[osm-search-data-export](https://github.com/trufi-association/osm-search-data-export) - Generates offline search data that includes POIs, streets and street junctions. The app currently uses the json-compact format.

[osm-public-transport-export](https://github.com/trufi-association/osm-public-transport-export) - Fetches OSM data and generates GeoJSON and additional files.

[geojson-to-gtfs](https://github.com/trufi-association/geojson-to-gtfs) - Turns generated GeoJSON and additional data into GTFS.

[gtfs-bolivia-cochabamba](https://github.com/trufi-association/gtfs-bolivia-cochabamba) - Config package that internally uses *osm-public-transport-export* and *geojson-to-gtfs* to generate a GTFS file to be used in OTP. Use this as a template to generate your own GTFS.

[OpenTripPlanner](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner) - Trip planning server that uses GTFS feeds for routing.
