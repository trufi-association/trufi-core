  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/data/cochabamba-gtfs.zip
    - assets/data/cochabamba.pbf
    - assets/data/places.json
    - assets/data/team.txt
    - assets/images/map_marker.svg
    - assets/tiles/8/
    - assets/tiles/9/
    - assets/tiles/10/
    - assets/tiles/11/
    - assets/tiles/12/
    - assets/tiles/13/
    - assets/tiles/14/
    # - assets/tiles/15/
    - test/assets/tile.png

  fonts:
  - family: CircleIcon
    fonts:
    - asset: fonts/CircleIcon.ttf

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.io/custom-fonts/#from-packages
